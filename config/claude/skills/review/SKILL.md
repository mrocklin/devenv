# Review - Spawn a Critical Review Agent

Start an agent to review our changes. The agent thinks critically and sends back its review using `tell_agent`.

## Usage

```
/review [optional context about what to review]
```

## Implementation

When invoked:

1. Use `mcp__chic__spawn_agent` to create a review agent with the following characteristics:
   - Name: "review-<topic>" (or similar)
   - Path: current working directory
   - Prompt should instruct the agent to:
     - Review recent changes (git diff, recent commits, modified files)
     - Think critically - look for bugs, edge cases, unclear code, missing tests
     - Consider maintainability and design
     - Use `tell_agent` to send its findings back to you when done
     - IMPORTANT: Include your agent name in the prompt so the reviewer knows who to `tell_agent` back to. Use `whoami` if you don't know your name.

2. If the user provided context, include it in the prompt to help focus the review.

3. Let the reviewer determine what's important - don't prescribe specific things to check.

## Review Cycle

After receiving feedback from the reviewer:

1. Address the issues raised
2. Use `ask_agent` to request another review from the same reviewer
3. Iterate until both parties agree the changes are in good shape
4. Once agreed, use `mcp__chic__close_agent` to close the reviewer agent

## Example Prompt for the Agent

```
Review the recent changes in this repository. Think critically:
- Look at git diff and recent commits
- Identify potential bugs, edge cases, or unclear code
- Consider design and maintainability
- Note anything that seems off or could be improved

[User context if provided]

When done, use tell_agent to send your review back to the agent that spawned you.
IMPORTANT: Your spawning agent's name is in the "[Spawned by agent '<NAME>']" header at the top of this conversation. Use that exact name.
If asked for a follow-up review, check that previous issues were addressed and look for any new concerns.
When everything looks good, say so clearly so we can wrap up.
```
